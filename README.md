# Data-Visualization-and-Storytelling
Creating a visual dashboard using Power BI with the Superstore dataset to uncover and present key business insights through clear, impactful visual storytelling.

I created the "Superstore Sales & Profit Insights" Power BI dashboard to analyze sales and profit performance. It shows a total sales of 2.30M and breaks down the data by region, category, and customer segment. I also included profit analysis across sub-categories to highlight the most and least profitable products. This dashboard provides clear, visual insights to support data-driven business decisions.
